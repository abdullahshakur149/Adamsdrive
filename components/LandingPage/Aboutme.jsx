          Hi, Iâ€™m Adam Zaza, a DVSA Qualified Driving Instructor with over 246+
          student passes in the record over a 4-year period and counting with a
          pass rate of 89%. Having previously worked with Red Driving School and
          DriveJohnsonâ€™s, I decided to start my own Driving School, dedicating
          my time and experience to this unique and valuable business. I help
          learners of all ages and backgrounds become safe and confident
          drivers. Iâ€™m passionate about what I do and pride myself on tailoring
          each lesson to suit the individual needs of my studentsâ€”whether youâ€™re
          stepping into the driverâ€™s seat for the first time or looking to
          refresh your skills.
