              Hi, Iâ€™m Adam Zaza, a DVSA Qualified Driving Instructor with over
              246+ student passes in the record over a 4-year period and
              counting with a pass rate of 89%. Being able to work previously
              with Red Driving School and DriveJohnsonâ€™s. I decided to start up
              my own Driving School dedicating my time and experience into this
              unique and precious business. I help learners of all ages and
              backgrounds become safe and confident drivers. Iâ€™m passionate
              about what I do and pride myself on tailoring each lesson to suit
              the individual needs of my studentsâ€”whether youâ€™re stepping into
              the driverâ€™s seat for the first time or looking to refresh your
              skills.
